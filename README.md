**2D THz-FDTD Inverse Imaging for Skin Hydration – Full Simulation Suite** 
**Novel 2D physics-informed inverse reconstruction of skin permittivity using THz-TDS and FDTD**   
**First 2D Inverse THz Imaging of skin hydration Gradient for the ε_r range of 6-9**

File "FDTD_Simulation_Reflected_pulse_Echo_timing_TV_reconstructions.py" contains the python code to simulate FDTD on the created model (Figure 1 of the output) along with calculating echo timing and generating a realistic reflected pulse (Figure 2 of the output) for the system. All the data calculated and generated is at the end used to for Total Variation (TV) Reconstruction (Figure 3 of the output)
